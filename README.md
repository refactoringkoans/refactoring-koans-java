# Learn Refactoring in Java

The Koans will walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn the
different Refactoring Patterns in the Java Programming language.

The Koans will also teach you patience and how to apply the different
Refactorings when you have no tool (a refactoring browser) available.

We encourage you not to use your IDE's _Refactorings_ while learning how to
refactor your code in order to learn the motions involved.

## Prerequisites

You will need Java SE Development Kit 8 installed in your machine in order to run the Koans.

Java SE Development Kit 8 can be found
[here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
